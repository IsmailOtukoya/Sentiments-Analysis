# Sentiments-Analysis
Sentiement analysis for movie reviews using Multinomial Naive Baiyes and Convolution Neural Network
The goal of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model that can predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews. The project will leverage two different approaches: Naive Bayes and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By implementing and comparing these two models, we aim to understand their strengths and weaknesses in the context of sentiment analysis.


Dataset Preparation:

Obtained a dataset of movie reviews with labeled sentiments (positive or negative).
Preprocessed the data by removing noise, such as HTML tags, punctuation, and stopwords.
Performed tokenization and convert the reviews into numerical representations suitable for modeling.

Naive Bayes Model:

Implemented a Naive Bayes classifier, specifically the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.
Train the model using the preprocessed movie review dataset.
Evaluated the model's performance by calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Analyzed the results and discuss the model's strengths and limitations for sentiment analysis.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Model:

Designed a CNN architecture suitable for text classification.
Converted the preprocessed movie reviews into word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe).
Trained the CNN model on the labeled dataset and tune hyperparameters as needed.
Evaluated the model's performance and compare it with the Naive Bayes model.
Analyzed the results, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and highlight the advantages of using CNN for sentiment analysis.

Model Comparison and Conclusion:

Comparde the performance of the Naive Bayes and CNN models.
Discuseds the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in the context of sentiment analysis.
Provided insights on when to use Naive Bayes or CNN for sentiment analysis tasks.
Summarized the overall project findings and discuss potential future improvements.

By completing this project, I demonstrated my ability to work with different algorithms (Naive Bayes and CNN) for sentiment analysis. This will showcase your skills in natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning.
