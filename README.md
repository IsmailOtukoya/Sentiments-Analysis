# Sentiments-Analysis
Sentiement analysis for movie reviews using Multinomial Naive Baiyes and Convolution Neural Network
The goal of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model that can predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews. The project will leverage two different approaches: Naive Bayes and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By implementing and comparing these two models, we aim to understand their strengths and weaknesses in the context of sentiment analysis.
